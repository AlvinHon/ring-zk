# Efficient Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Commitments from RLWE

Rust implementation of the zero-knowledge proof system for commitments from the Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) assumption. The proof system is based on the paper [More Efficient Commitments from Structured Lattice Assumptions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/997).
